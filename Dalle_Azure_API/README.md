# Azure AI Image Generation with Dalle

## Overview / Use Case
This project demonstrates how to generate images using **Azure AI Foundry** models and access them programmatically via Python and VS Code.  
The use case is to automate **image creation** for applications like content generation, design mockups, or AI-driven creative tools.

## Technology Used
- **Azure AI Foundry**: Hosting and deploying AI models
- **Azure OpenAI API**: To call deployed models programmatically
- **Python**: Backend scripting for sending requests and handling responses
- **VS Code**: Development environment
- **python-dotenv**: For managing environment variables securely

## Key Features
- Generate AI-powered images using a deployed Azure model
- Call the model from local Python scripts using **endpoint + API key**
- Save generated images locally
- Easy to extend for different prompts, models, or workflows
- Demonstrates integration of **cloud-hosted AI models** into local apps

## Example Output

Hereâ€™s an example of an image generated using Azure AI Foundry:
